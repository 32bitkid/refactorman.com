<p>I craft compelling interactions between people and machines and bring a
diverse background of technologies, experiences and passions. I want to help
build the tools and applications that will empower people to work, play,
and—most importantly—<em>create</em>.</p>
<p>If you share my love of programming—whether a fellow developer, a
potential employer, a client, or just someone who wants to learn—then
get in touch; I’d love to hear from you!</p>

pair previous co-workers. I joined the team as the second
developer—third employee—bringing my skills as a UI specialist to the team.
My skill-set directly complemented the technical founder and we worked
closely to define, architect and build the pilot system. My
responsibilities ranged from full-stack pair development to database
design to devops to graphic/web design to marketing to motion graphics;
members of small teams wear many hats.</p>

to realize and iterate the UI/UX of the application: a UAV flight
planning, logging, and compliance SAAS. Built on Angular.js, I implemented
the front-end on-top of the Java backend. Worked dilligently to establish
the automated testing and build pipelines. Helped mentor junior developers
within the front-end stack, and helped expose and transition the team
towards more functional programming paradigms available in Java 8.</p>

full of some of the smartest and most passionate people I’ve had the
opportunity to work with. It is where I fell in love with
pair-programming. I joined the team as a full-stack developer; focusing on
improving UI and the state of the front-end stack.</p>
<p>While at VersionOne, I was the Feature Lead of a team of 4 developers on a
high-profile, well-received <a href="https://www.versionone.com/product/agile-team-software/">feature</a>
of the flagship application. During my last year at VersionOne, I was
tapped to be a Team Lead, one of only three on the development team. In
that role, I helped guide, mentor, and support the devs and designers on
my team and coordinate with the other teams and Product Owners to deliver
high-quality features and releases.</p>

work I’ve gotten to do professionally. They needed a library of reusable
custom UI-framework components. The most ambitious of which was a custom
mobile/desktop ready real-time 3D panoramic viewer compoment in Flash/AS3.
I had to dust off several math textbooks from college and refresh my
working memory of vector and matrix math. However, it was great fun to
implement a 3D renderer from almost first principals. A lot more work went
into optimizing performance and building an API and documentation for RAD
consumption by graphic designers and other junior developers on their team.</p>

conscripted on to the development team where I helped mentor the team in
ASP.NET MVC, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery best practices. As a Front-End
Developer, over the course of two years, I was helped establish
design frameworks and tools for the rest of the development team. I
continued to work closely with both the business analysts and development
teams to plan, architect, build and maintain the BDD test suite. Finally,
I served as team ScrumMaster until my departure, assisting in the
on-going effort to move to a more agile work paradigm.</p>

With a half-dozen volunteer mentors and teachers, we had classes and
